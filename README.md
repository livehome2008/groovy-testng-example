=====================

The Groovy language can reduce the amount of curly brackets and overall code when compared to Java.  For shops that do
not wish to replace Java with Groovy as their development language, Groovy can still be leveraged as a mechanism to
create smaller, less cluttered test code.

This project demonstrates the use of Groovy and TestNG for unit and integration tests.
